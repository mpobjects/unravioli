# UnRavioli

Builds a graph of module dependencies. A module is defined as a source location. All java files in these source locations are analyzed to find out how the different "modules" are interconnected.

This can be used to unravel the dependencies between source directories in order to create proper modules from this collection of source location.

FIXME: this is experimental code and "works for me".
